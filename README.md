GCSE Python Project

This is some code to get students started. Here is the basic idea...

Each person has their own python file which contains the logic for moving between the locations, and also contains your own version of the fighting algorithm.

Different people in your group will write the code for different locations. Each person will do that in a cunningly named file which the rest of the group can import. That way, you can share each other's code and complete the game.

A side effect of this is that if one person commits a file which is broken, all the people in the group will find their code coean't work! No Pressure.....
